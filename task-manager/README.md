# Lab Title: 
Lab 3: Lists, keys, and Conditionals


# Date Completed: 
December 9, 2025

# Lab Description: 
 In this lab, I created a Task Management application that demonstrates dynamic list rendering, proper key usage, and conditional rendering. I practiced creating TypeScript React components that handled lists of data, implement filtering, and show different states based on task properties. This lab focuses on list rendering, key management, conditional rendering, and component composition using React and TypeScript.

# My reflection:

# How did you ensure unique keys for your list items?

I used a different id number or letter number combination for each task making them unique.

# What considerations did you make when implementing the filtering functionality?

I wanted users to be able to easily change the status or priority with ease. The checkmark easily indicates the selection.


# How did you handle state updates for task status changes?

I ensured that the current state and the setter function had the same name. I used different useState hooks.


# What challenges did you face when implementing conditional rendering?

*will update soon.
